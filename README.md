This repo contains of two separate projects: the Grant Calculator and the Sriest Calculator Projects. 

The Grant Calculator is a sample project that uses JSP in order to simulate a website that would calculate the grant money
awarded to a student entering into college. 

The Series Calculator builds a logic for creating the Taylor and McLauren Series (based on Calculus).
