This repo contains of three separate projects: the Grant Calculator, the Sries Calculator, and the Grant Calculator 2 Projects. 

The Grant Calculator 2 is a sample project that uses JSP in order to simulate a website that would calculate the grant money
awarded to a student entering into college. 

The Grant Calculator project simply contains the backend logic of the Grant Calculator 2 project. 

The Series Calculator builds a logic for creating the Taylor and McLauren Series (based on Calculus).
